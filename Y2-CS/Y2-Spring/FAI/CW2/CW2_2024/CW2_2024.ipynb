    "2. Use `Code` cell to input your code. \n",
    "**Note: (a). please run your code in the notebook and upload your notebook together with all the outputs. (b). avoid using problem setting requires more than 3 mins to get the output. (c). Please only import the packages that are offered in our coursework folder or as the question requirement. (d). If you import other external pacakges, we will remove that and mark your code with the remaining code. **\n",

Please be very careful not to cross the boundary into plagiarism while having general discussions regarding the coursework to promote the generation of new ideas and to enhance the learning experience. The important part is that when you sit down to actually do the work and write the answers, you do it individually. If you do this, and you truly understand what you have written, you will not be guilty of plagiarism. Do NOT, under any circumstances, share code or share figures, graphs or charts, etc.\n",
