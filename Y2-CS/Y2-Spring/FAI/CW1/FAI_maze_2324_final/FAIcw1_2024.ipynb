    "# FAI Coursework One - Maze Search [15 Marks]\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of coursework one is to give you first-hand experience on implementing search techniques for solving the problems in Python, one of the mostly adapted high level languages and analytic tools in business and research. The questions are designed to help on your understanding of concept of `problem formulation`, `search algorithms`, `algorithm evluation` and their implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In completion of this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Students are expected to master the knowledge of formulating maze problem.\n",
    "- Students are expected to use different search algorithms to solve the `maze` problem.\n",
    "- Students are expected know how to implement and evluate different **search algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this coursework, you are required to complete the implementation of `maze` problem formulation and some `search` algorithms for the `maze` game. Please use the given code to complete the questions and provide your answer/report in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marks\n",
    "\n",
    "Coursework 1 accounts for 15% of the COMP1037 marks. Corresponding marks will be awarded for completing the questions in `FAIcw1_2024.ipynb`. Both **Code** implementation and **report** (text explaination of your design) should be written using this file as the template.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b> c：</b> Avoid making any modifications to the three provided modules: maze.py and searchCW.py. Altering these modules will result in a loss of half your marks.\n",

    "# Plagiarism vs. Group Discussions\n",
    "\n",
    "As you should know, there is no tolerance of plagiarism, and any breach of which will be dealt with according to the University's standard policies. Please be very careful not to cross the boundary into plagiarism while having general discussions regarding the coursework to promote the generation of new ideas and to enhance the learning experience. The important part is that when you sit down to actually do the work and write the answers, you do it individually. If you do this, and you truly understand what you have written, you will not be guilty of plagiarism. Do NOT, under any circumstances, share code or share figures, graphs or charts, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deadline and submission procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission deadline is 5pm on the **19  April 2024** via Moodle. Late submission results into a 5% reduction of your coursework mark for each weekday. Any work handed in after the 29th April will receive zero marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name your submission file: <code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\"> FAIcw1-XXX.ipynb, </code> where XXX should be your student number, and submit the single <code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\"> .ipynb or .zip </code>  file via Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can’t submit your coursework on time due to Extenuating Circumstances, please contact your personal tutor first. I am only granting an extension of submission based on his / her recommendation."
