Question 1:
1. My code only accepts input as integers, if the input is a decimal, letter or non-integer, the code prompts invalid input! Please input again!

2. I treat 0123 as 123 and put into the calculation.

3. If the input is overflow, it will print "invalid input! Please input again!", In this case, invalid input includes input overflow.

4. If overflow occurred during the calculation, it will print" Overflow occurred!"

Question2:
I showed three aspects of Computer Architecture, the first one is Multicore Architecture, the second one is Reduced Instruction Set Computer(RISC) and the third is Single Instruction, Multiple Data(SIMD).
Then I choose one aspect which is SIMD to present in detail.
I showed SIMD from three sub-topics, the first one is Vector Architecture, the second one is SIMD Extensions for Mobile Systems and Multimedia Applications and the third one is Graphics Processing Units(GPU)
